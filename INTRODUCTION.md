# Getting-Started-With-NODE-JS

## NODE JS

#### Nodejs is basically built to communicate with server which initially was not possible in JS, as JS was restricted to client side only.

### INITIALIZATION

 Anyone can easily Download it from [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en)

In your flutter project make a folder at root named as server, and initialize your node there, use terminal and in server directory run the initialization command

### npm stands for Node Package Manager

after running the command, a package.json file will automatically built in server folder

- Creating **Index.js** in server folder, you can change the name of **index.js** but you should change the **index.js** in **package.json** file first.

  - You can try out a simple script to check if it is working fine or not
